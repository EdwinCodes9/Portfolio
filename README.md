//1.I started by setting up a very simple HTML Layout importing my jquery, js, style sheet.

//2.Once I was satisfied I uploaded just my basic html layout with css styling to netlify to avoid any issues once I started my jquery and js 

//3.Once I had everything in place I started my js and jquery 

//4. I onky wanted 3 points off interaction to essentially meet  the requirements.I chose a modal, toogle function that I used to show and hid my divs and a couresel with two pictures  of me.


//5.For my slideToggle I use the MDN website as a refrence and tutorial, for the couresel I refrenced the corgi lesson which made it extremely easy to create a couresel that suits my needs, and for the modal I refrenced the modal lesson.

            Salvador, and Raise in Oakland, CA.</p>
        <p>Im a first generation immigrant living the American Dream. Im 22 years young, and cant wait to break</p>
        <p>into the software engineering field. I love problem solving and working with others. That is why enjoy</p>
        <p>coding so much. Coding allows you to attack these complex problems and break them down to their core.</p>
        <p>Making complex problem seem not so complex</p>
        <br>
        <br>

        <h4>Brief discription of Project UF:</h4>
        <p>Project Uf is a webpage taylored to one of my friends needs. My friend owns the company Urban Flavours.</p>
        <p>It is the number one cannabis delivery service in northen California. He is a genius entrepenuer </p>
        <p>The only thing holding him back was his outdate and basic webpage. He has tried various different developing
        </p>
        <p>companies, but none of them really understand his needs, but I do. I temporally worked as delivery driver</p>
        <p>for my friend while making ends meet in college, and I understand exactly what the companies webpage needed.
        </p>
        <p>So I developed a taylored made website for Urban Flavours meeting all of the companies need with an updated
            and modern look.</p>

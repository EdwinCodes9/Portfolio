                        <h1>PROJECT UF:</h1>
                        <p>Project Uf is a webpage taylored to one of my friends needs. My friend owns the company Urban
                            Flavours.

                            It is the number one cannabis delivery service in northen California. He is a genius
                            entrepenuer

                            The only thing holding him back was his outdate and basic webpage. He has tried various
                            different
                            developing

                            companies, but none of them really understand his needs, but I do. I temporally worked as
                            delivery
                            driver

                            for my friend while making ends meet in college, and I understand exactly what the companies
                            webpage
                            needed.

                            So I developed a taylored made website for Urban Flavours meeting all of the companies need
                            with
                            an
                            updated and modern look.</p>
